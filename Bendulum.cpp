 *
 *   A "bendulum" is a long, slender, springy piece of metal, held vertically, whose lower end is fixed and whose upper 
 *   end has a weight that is free to move back and forth -- a sort of upside-down pendulum. A bendulum terminates in a 
 *   magnet that moves across a many-turn coil of fine wire positioned at the center of its swing. The motion of the magnet 
 *   is detected as it passes over the coil by the current the magnet induces. Just after the magnet passes, a pulse of 
 *   current through the coil induces a magnetic field in it. The field gives the magnet a small push, keeping the bendulum 
 *   going. A Bendulum object works just as well for a pendulum whose bob has a magnet at its end.
 *
 *   The main method is beat(). This method is intended to be invoked repeatedly in the loop() function of an Arduino sketch.
 *   Each time the magnet passes, beat() returns the number of microseconds that have passed since the magnet passed the
 *   last time. In this way, the bendulum can be used to drive a time-of-day clock display.
 *
 *   A Bendulum object has three operational modes. The way the duration of a beat is determined depends on which mode the 
 *   Bendulum object is in:
 *
 *           Mode          Beat duration determined by
 *           ===========   ========================================================================================
 *           SETTLING      The duration returned is measured using the (corrected) Arduino real-time Clock.
 *           SCALING       The duration returned is measured using the (corrected) Arduino real-time Clock.
 *           CALIBRATING   A running average of beat duration is updated using the measured duration of the current 
 *                         beat. As in the SETTLING mode, the current duration is measured with the (corrected) 
 *                         Arduino real-time clock. The updated average is returned.
 *           CALFINISH     The duration returned is the value of the running average. No measurement is done.
 *           RUNNING       The duration returned is the value of the running average. No measurement is done.
 *
 *   Unless setRunMode() is used to change it, when beat() is first called the Bendulum object is in SETTLING mode. 
 *   It continues in this mode for getTgtSettle() cycles (one cycle = two beats). The purpose of this mode is to let
 *   the bendulum or pendulum settle into a regular motion since its motion is typically disturbed at startup from 
 *   having been given a start-up push by hand. Once it completes SETTLING the Bendulum object switches to SCALING mode 
 *   for getTgtScale() cycles. During SCALING mode, the peak voltage induced in the coil by the passing magnet is 
 *   determined and saved in peakScale. With SCALING over, the Bendulum object moves to CALIBRATING mode, in which it 
 *   remains for getTgtSmoothing() additional cycles. During CALIBRATING mode, the average duration of tick and tock 
 *   beats is measured and saved in tickAvg, tockAvg and their average -- uspb. At the end of CALIBRATING the Bendulum 
 *   object switches to CALFINISH mode for one beat. The CALFINISH mode serves as notice to the using sketch that 
 *   calibration is now complete. At that point the Bendulum object switches to RUNNING mode, in which it remains 
 *   indefinitely.
 *
 *   The net effect is that the Bendulum object automatically characterizes the bendulum or pendulum it is driving,
 *   first by measuring the strength of the pulses it induces in the coil and second by measuring the average duration 
 *   of its beat. Once the measurements are done, the Bendulum object assumes the bendulum or pendulum is isochronous.
 *
 *   This would work nearly perfectly except that the real-time clock in most Arduinos is stable but not too accurate 
 *   (it's a ceramic resonator, not a crystal). That is, real-time clock ticks are essentially equal to one another in 
 *   duration but their durations are not exactly the number of microseconds they should be. To correct for this, we use 
 *   a correction factor, getBias(). The value of getBias() is the number of tenths of a second per day by which the 
 *   real-time clock in the Arduino must be compensated in order for it to be accurate. This number may be set using 
 *   setBias() and incremented/decremented by using incrBias(). Positive bias means the real-time clock's "microseconds" 
 *   are shorter than real microseconds.
 *
 *   In addition to just instantiating a Bendulum object and letting it go through its modes, it's possible to change the
 *   mode as required using setRunMode(). For example, to recalibrate, simply do a setRunMode(CALIBRATING). The bendulum 
 *   will enter CALIBRATING mode, do a calibration run and then enter CALFINISH for a beat and, finally, settle into 
 *   RUNNING mode.
 *
 *   It is also possible to operate a bendulum whose parameters you *know* and and skip all the automatic calibration
 *   stuff. After instantiating the Bendulum object, put it in RUNNING mode by invoking setRunMode(RUNNING) and then set 
 *   the beat duration with setBeatDuration() and the peak scaling with setPeakScale().
